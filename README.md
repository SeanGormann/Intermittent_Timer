# Intermittent_Timer
Timer that gives randomly interspaced notifications

I've been using this timer as a study tool since I created it a couple of months back. The idea is this: micro rests of "mindfullness" randomly interspaced throughout a bout of learning can improve learning retention. This timer takes two inputs from the user; 1) a minimum time (in mins) to wait before the timer goes off and 2) a miximum time (in mins) to wait before the timer goes off. A time is randomly taken between these two intervals and sets off the timer. The program then repeats, taking a new random time from the previously defined inputs. I typically use a min time of 5m and a max time of 15m.
